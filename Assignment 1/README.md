# HOW TO RUN
I am recommending testing the algorithms in jupyter notebook because of the structure and order.
##### JUPYTER NOTEBOOK
- Use the terminal.  
- Go to the placement of the jupyter notebook-file, and type ‘jupyter notebook’ to
open the jupyter notebook. Here you can klick on the ‘Assignment01.ipynb’-file to
access the file.  
- To run the code, simply click in the first code-box and press ctrl+enter.  
- It is really important that the code gets EXCECUTED IN ORDER of the boxes. This
means that if you want to check out the 'genetic algorithm' first you have to run ALL THE CODE BEFORE THE GENETIC ALGORITHM IN ORDER.
